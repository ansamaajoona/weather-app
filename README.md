# Weather App made in React with Typescript

Real-time weather for Oulu, Finland.

## Features
- Current weather (temperature, wind speed, precipitation)
- Hourly chart of temperature
- Next 7 days weather
- Option to choose temperature unit

## Potential plans
- More data about the weather
- Better looking icons to improve the user experience
- Better error handling on api call errors; Let the user know what's going on when error occurs.
- Weather data about different locations, instead of just one. For example a search option for the user.
